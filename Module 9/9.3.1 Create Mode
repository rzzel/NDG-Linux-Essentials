Creating and compressing tar archives is a common and useful operation in Linux. The tar command, as you mentioned, has several options and modes for creating and manipulating archives. Here's a summary of the key options and modes for creating and compressing tar archives:

Create Mode:

-c: This option tells tar to create an archive.
-f ARCHIVE: Use the -f option followed by the name of the archive file you want to create. The ARCHIVE is the name of the resulting archive file.
FILE...: All the remaining arguments are considered as input file names, which can be specified as a wildcard, a list of files, or both.

For example, to create a tar archive named alpha_files.tar from files in the current directory that begin with "alpha," you can use the following command:

tar -cf alpha_files.tar alpha*


Compressing with gzip:
-z: To compress an archive using the gzip command. This results in a smaller compressed archive.
To create and compress a tar archive with gzip, use the -z option in addition to other options like -c and -f, like this:

tar -czf alpha_files.tar.gz alpha*

The compressed archive will have a .tar.gz extension, which is the convention for gzip-compressed tar archives.

Compressing with bzip2:

-j: To compress an archive using the bzip2 command. This typically results in better compression ratios but may be slower.
To create and compress a tar archive with bzip2, use the -j option along with other options. The resulting archive will typically have a .tar.bz2, .tbz, or .tbz2 extension:

tar -cjf folders.tbz School

Keep in mind that you can choose the compression method (gzip or bzip2) depending on your needs and preferences. The .tar.gz and .tar.bz2 extensions help identify the compression method used in the archive.

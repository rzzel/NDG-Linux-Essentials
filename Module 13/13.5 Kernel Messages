The /var/log/dmesg file contains the kernel messages that were produced during system startup. The /var/log/messages file contains kernel messages that are produced as the system is running, but those messages are mixed in with other messages from daemons or processes.

Although the kernel doesn't have its own log file normally, one can be configured for it by modifying either the /etc/syslog.conf file or the /etc/rsyslog.conf file. In addition, the dmesg command can be used to view the kernel ring buffer, which holds a large number of messages that are generated by the kernel.‌⁠​​⁠​ 

On an active system, or one experiencing many kernel errors, the capacity of this buffer may be exceeded, and some messages might be lost. The size of this buffer is set at the time the kernel is compiled, so it is not trivial to change.

Executing the dmesg command can produce up to 512 kilobytes of text, so filtering the command with a pipe to another command like less or grep is recommended. For example, if a user were troubleshooting problems with a USB device, then searching for the text USB with the grep command is helpful. The -i option is used to ignore case:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ dmesg | grep -i usb
usbcore: registered new interface driver usbfs
usbcore: registered new interface driver hub
usbcore: registered new device driver usb
ehci_hcd: USB 2.0 'Enhanced' Host Controller (EHCI) Driver
ohci_hcd: USB 1.1 'Open' Host Controller (OHCI) Driver
ohci_hcd 0000:00:06.0: new USB bus registered, assigned bus number 1
usb usb1: New USB device found, idVendor=1d6b, idProduct=0001
usb usb1: New USB device strings: Mfr=3, Product=2, SerialNumber=1

An implementation of the Linux kernel includes many subsystems that are a part of the kernel itself and others that may be loaded in a modular fashion when needed. Key functions of the Linux kernel include a system call interface, process management, memory management, virtual filesystems, networking, and device drivers.

In short, via a shell, the kernel accepts commands from the user and manages the processes that carry out those commands by giving them access to devices such as memory, disks, network interfaces, keyboards, mice, monitors and more.

A typical Linux system has thousands of files. The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard provides a guideline for distributions on how to organize these files. It is important to understand the role of the Linux kernel and how it both processes and provides information about the system under the /proc and /sys pseudo filesystems.

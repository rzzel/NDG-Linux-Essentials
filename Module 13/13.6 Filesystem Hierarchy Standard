Among the standards supported by the Linux Foundation is the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), which is hosted at the URL http://www.pathname.com/fhs/.

A standard is a set of rules or guidelines that it is recommended to follow. However, these guidelines certainly can be broken, either by entire distributions or by administrators on individual machines.

The FHS standard categorizes each system directory in a couple of ways:

A directory can be categorized as either shareable or not, referring to whether the directory can be shared on a network and used by multiple machines.
The directory is put into a category of having either static files (file contents won't change) or variable files (file contents can change).
To make these classifications, it is often necessary to refer to subdirectories below the top level of directories. For example, the /var directory itself cannot be categorized as either shareable or not shareable, but one of its subdirectories, the /var/mail directory, is shareable. Conversely, the /var/lock directory should not be shareable.

Not Shareable	Shareable
Variable	/var/lock	/var/mail
Static	/etc	/opt

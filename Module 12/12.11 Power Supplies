Power supplies are the devices that convert alternating current (120v, 240v) into direct current, which the computer uses at various voltages (3.3v, 5v, 12v). Power supplies are generally not programmable; however, their proper function has a major impact on the rest of the system.

Although they are not typically designed as surge suppressors, these devices often protect the computer from fluctuations in voltage coming from the power source. It is wise for a network administrator to choose a power supply based on quality rather than price since a failing power supply can result in significant damage to a computer system.

Desktop, server tower, rack and standalone systems are more vulnerable to power fluctuations than laptop systems are. If the power fluctuates, it can cause much havoc on the non-battery based systems, whereas a laptop simply keeps pulling power from its internal battery until depleted.

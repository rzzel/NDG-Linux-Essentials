The motherboard, or system board, is the main hardware board in the computer through which the central processing unit (CPU), random-access memory (RAM) and other components are all connected. Depending on the computer type (laptop, desktop, server) some devices, such as processors and RAM, are attached directly to the motherboard, while other devices, such as add-on cards, are connected via a bus.

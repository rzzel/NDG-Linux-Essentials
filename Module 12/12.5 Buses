A computer's buses and peripheral devices play a critical role in facilitating communication between various computer components. Here's an overview of buses, peripheral devices, and how they are used in different types of computer systems:

Buses:

Definition: A bus is a high-speed communication channel that allows different components within a computer to exchange data and instructions.
Types of Buses: There are various types of buses within a computer system, including the Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) and Universal Serial Bus (USB) among others.
Motherboard Connections: Buses on the motherboard enable multiple devices to connect to the system. These buses include expansion slots for attaching cards (e.g., video, network, and peripheral cards) as well as connectors for peripherals like monitors, keyboards, and mice.
Desktop and Server Computers: In these systems, a motherboard houses components such as the processor and RAM. These systems also have high-speed buses that support additional components connected via expansion cards.
Laptop and Compact Systems: In these systems, most components are directly connected to the motherboard, reducing the ability to swap or upgrade devices. Although the bus still exists, it doesn't provide the flexibility to add or replace components.
Peripheral Devices:

Definition: Peripheral devices are hardware components connected to a computer system that provide input, output, or data storage capabilities.
Examples of Peripherals: Common peripheral devices include keyboards, mice, monitors, printers, and hard disk drives.
Accessing Peripherals: The system communicates with these devices to perform functions beyond central processing.
Viewing PCI Devices: To list devices connected via the PCI bus, you can use the lspci command. This command provides information about devices such as VGA controllers (for monitors), SCSI storage controllers (for hard drives), and Ethernet controllers (for networking).
Viewing USB Devices: USB devices are commonly used for both internal and external connections. You can use the lsusb command to display devices connected via USB. Unlike PCI devices, USB devices are hot-pluggable, meaning they can be connected or disconnected while the system is running.
Here are some example outputs of the lspci and lsusb commands:

Example lspci Output:

Optical drives, often referred to as CD-ROMs, DVDs, or Blu-Ray, are removable storage media. While some devices used with optical disks are read-only, others are capable of burning (writing to) disks, when using a writable type of disk. There are various standards for writable and rewritable disks, such as CD-R, CD+R, DVD+RW, and DVD-RW.

Where these removable disks are mounted in the file system is an important consideration for a Linux administrator. Modern distributions often mount the disks under the /media folder, while older distributions typically mount them under the /mnt folder. For example, a USB thumb drive might be mounted on the /media/usbthumb path.

Upon mounting, most GUI interfaces prompt the user to take some action, such as open the contents of the disk in a file browser or start a media program. When the user is finished using the disk, it is necessary to unmount it using a menu or the umount command.

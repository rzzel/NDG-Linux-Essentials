Email services on Linux servers involve several components to ensure the smooth transfer and delivery of electronic messages. Here's an overview:

1. Mail Transfer Agent (MTA):
   - Responsible for transferring electronic messages to other systems.
   - Sendmail: Well-known MTA with a long history.
   - Postfix: Popular alternative aiming for simplicity and security.

2. Mail Delivery Agent (MDA):
   - Also known as the Local Delivery Agent.
   - Handles storing emails in the user's mailbox.
   - Usually invoked from the final MTA in the email chain.

3. POP/IMAP Server:
   - POP (Post Office Protocol) and IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol):
     Communication protocols enabling email clients to retrieve messages from a remote server.
   - Dovecot: Popular POP/IMAP server known for its ease of use and low maintenance.
   - Cyrus IMAP: Another option for POP/IMAP services.
   - Some servers implement their mail database format for performance and may include the MDA if a custom database is desired.

In the open-source world, modularity is a key feature. Various components can be included or swapped out for package components, providing flexibility. Unlike closed-source solutions, where software packages are shipped as a complete suite, open-source solutions often allow users to choose individual components or customize the composition of a package.

For example, Microsoft Exchange in the closed-source world is a bundled suite of components from a single vendor. In contrast, open-source solutions offer the freedom to mix and match components seamlessly, creating a harmonious working environment with diverse, modular choices for users.

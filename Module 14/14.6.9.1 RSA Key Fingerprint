When using the ssh command, the first prompt asks you to verify the identity of the machine you are logging into. In most cases, you are going to want to answer yes. While you can check with the administrator of the remote machine to make sure that the RSA key fingerprint is correct, this isn't the purpose of this query. It is designed for future login attempts.

After you answer yes, the RSA key fingerprint of the remote machine is stored on your local system. When you attempt to ssh to this same machine in the future, the RSA key fingerprint provided by the remote machine is compared to the copy stored on the local machine. If they match, then the username prompt appears. If they don't match, an error like the following displays:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ ssh bob@test
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@   WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!   @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
It is also possible that the RSA host key has just been changed.
The fingerprint for the RSA key sent by the remote host is
c2:0d:ff:27:4c:f8:69:a9:c6:3e:13:da:2f:47:e4:c9.
Please contact your system administrator.
Add correct host key in /home/sysadmin/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
Offending key in /home/sysadmin/.ssh/known_hosts:1
RSA host key for test has changed and you have requested strict checking.
Host key verification failed.
This error could indicate that a rogue host has replaced the correct host. Check with the administrator of the remote system. If the system were recently reinstalled, it would have a new RSA key, and that would be causing this error.

In the event that this error message is due to a remote machine reinstall, you can remove the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file from your local system (or just remove the entry for that one machine) and try to connect again:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ cat ~/.ssh/known_hosts

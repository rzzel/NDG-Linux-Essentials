In a Linux system, name resolution is an essential process for translating human-readable hostnames or domain names into IP addresses, allowing communication on the network. This process involves several critical files and configurations, as you've mentioned:

/etc/hosts:

The /etc/hosts file contains a table of static hostname-to-IP address mappings.
Entries in this file are checked before querying DNS servers.
It can be used to supplement DNS and provide local name resolution.
/etc/resolv.conf:

The /etc/resolv.conf file specifies the IP addresses of the name servers (usually DNS servers) that the system should consult when attempting to resolve hostnames to IP addresses.
It may also contain additional keywords and values that affect the resolution process.
The nameserver lines list the IP addresses of DNS servers.
/etc/nsswitch.conf:

The /etc/nsswitch.conf file configures the order in which different name resolution sources are consulted.
It determines the order in which name services are used for various operations, such as hostname resolution.
The hosts entry in this file specifies the order of name resolution sources. For example: hosts: files dns means to check local files (/etc/hosts) first, and if not found, query DNS servers.
Here's how the name resolution process works based on the configuration in these files:

nsswitch.conf: The system consults /etc/nsswitch.conf to determine the order of name resolution sources. In the example hosts: files dns, the system looks at local files first (/etc/hosts) and then queries DNS servers.

/etc/hosts: The system checks the /etc/hosts file for a match to the requested hostname. If a match is found, the resolution process is complete.

DNS Servers: If the local /etc/hosts file doesn't contain a match, the system proceeds to query the DNS servers listed in /etc/resolv.conf. The DNS resolution system starts with the first listed name server and falls back to the subsequent ones if necessary.

For example, if your /etc/resolv.conf contains:

nameserver 10.0.2.3
nameserver 10.0.2.4

The system queries the first DNS server (10.0.2.3), and if it doesn't respond or a timeout is reached, it queries the second DNS server (10.0.2.4).

If a DNS server provides a valid IP address for the requested hostname, that IP address is returned to the system and used for initiating a network connection. Additionally, the result is cached in the system's DNS cache for a configurable time period to improve future name resolution performance.

The presence and order of name resolution sources in these configuration files allow Linux systems to efficiently resolve hostnames to IP addresses. This process ensures reliable connectivity by using local files and DNS servers while allowing for redundancy and failover.

A router or gateway allows hosts from one network to communicate with hosts on another network.

The route command displays the kernel's IP routing table, which defines how network packets are forwarded.

In the routing table, you can see entries for destination networks, gateways, netmasks, flags, metrics, and network interfaces.

The "*" in the gateway field indicates that packets for the 192.168.1.0 network are sent directly to the destination without going through a gateway.

The "default" entry with the gateway address of 192.168.1.1 serves as the default route for all other network packets.

Using the -n option with the route command displays numeric data only, which can be useful to simplify the output.

The ip route or ip route show command can also be used to display routing information and is becoming the preferred method in modern Linux distributions.

The output of ip route or ip route show provides information similar to the route command but with a different format.

The "0.0.0.0" entry refers to all other machines and is equivalent to the default route.

The transition from route to ip route aligns with the trend of using the ip command for comprehensive network management tasks.

The ip route command provides detailed routing information and is the recommended choice for viewing and configuring routing tables in modern Linux systems.

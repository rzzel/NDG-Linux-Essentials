On a CentOS system, the primary configuration file for an IPv4 network interface is the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 file. The VM in this chapter is Debian-based, and so does not have the sysconfig folder. However, for demonstration purposes only, the following shows what this file looks like when configured for a static IP address

root@localhost:~# cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
DEVICE="eth0"
BOOTPROTO=none
NM_CONTROLLED="yes"
ONBOOT=yes
TYPE="Ethernet"
UUID="98cf38bf-d91c-49b3-bb1b-f48ae7f2d3b5"
DEFROUTE=yes
IPV4 _FAILURE_FATAL=yes
IPV6INOT=no
NAME="System eth0"
IPADDR=192.168.1.1
PREFIX=24
GATEWAY=192.168.1.1
DNS1=192.168.1.2
HWADDR=00:50:56:90:18:18
LAST_CONNECT=1376319928
If the device were configured to be a DHCP client, the BOOTPROTO value would be set to dhcp, and the IPADDR, GATEWAY and DNS1 values would not be set.

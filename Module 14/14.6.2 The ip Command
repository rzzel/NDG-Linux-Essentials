ifconfig is a traditional command used for network configuration and display, but it is becoming deprecated in favor of the ip command.

The ip command offers more advanced networking capabilities and is considered the standard for network configuration and management in modern Linux distributions.

The ip command follows the format: ip [OPTIONS] OBJECT COMMAND.

Although the ip command may appear more verbose, it provides a comprehensive set of options for managing network configurations.

It covers tasks that were previously handled by separate commands like route and arp, making it a more versatile tool.

The transition from ifconfig to ip is driven by the need for a more powerful and flexible networking tool.

While ifconfig is still available and can be used, especially on older systems or for quick reference, it's recommended to get familiar with the ip command for more advanced networking tasks.

This transition aligns with the broader trend in Linux towards using the ip command for network management.

The ssh command allows you to connect to another machine across the network, log in and then perform tasks on the remote machine.

If you only provide a machine name or IP address to log into, the ssh command assumes you want to log in using the same username that you are currently logged in as. To use a different username, use the syntax:

username@hostname
root@localhost:~# ssh bob@test
The authenticity of host ‘test (127.0.0.1)’ can’t be established.
RSA key fingerprint is c2:0d:ff:27:4c:f8:69:a9:c6:3e:13:da:2f:47:e4:c9.
Are you sure you want to continue connection (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added ‘test’ (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
bob@test’s password:
bob@test:~$ date

To return back to the local machine, use the exit command:

bob@test:~$ exit
logout
Connection to test closed.

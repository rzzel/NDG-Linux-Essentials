In addition to the networking terms discussed in the last section, there are some additional terms with which you should be familiar. These terms focus more on the different types of networking services that are commonly used, as well as some of the techniques that are used to communicate between machines.

Packet	A network packet is used to send network communication between hosts. By breaking down communication into smaller chunks (packets), the data delivery method is much more efficient.
IP Address	An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a unique number assigned to a host on a network. Hosts use these numbers to address network communication.
Mask	Also called a netmask, subnet mask or mask, a network mask is a number system that can be used to define which IP addresses are considered to be within a single network. Because of how routers perform their functions, networks have to be clearly defined.
Hostname	Each host on a network could have its own hostname because names are more natural for humans to remember than numbers, making it easier for us to address network packets to another host. Hostnames are translated into IP addresses before the network packet is sent on the network.
URL	A Uniform Resource Locator (URL), also commonly called a web address, is used to locate a resource, like a web page, on the internet. Itâ€™s what you type into your web browser to access a web page. For example, http://www.netdevgroup.com. It includes the protocol http:// and the hostname www.netdevgroup.com.
DHCP	Hosts can be assigned hostnames, IP addresses and other network-related information by a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server. In the world of computers, a protocol is a well-defined set of rules. DHCP defines how network information is assigned to client hosts, and the DHCP server is the machine that provides this information.
DNS	As mentioned previously, hostnames are translated into IP addresses, prior to the network packet being sent on the network. So your host needs to know the IP address of all of the other hosts with which you are communicating. When working on a large network (like the Internet), this can pose a challenge as there are so many hosts. A Domain Name System (DNS) provides the service of translating domain names into IP addresses.
Ethernet	In a wired network environment, Ethernet is the most common way to physically connect the hosts into a network. Ethernet cables are connected to network cards that support Ethernet connections. Ethernet cables and devices (such as routers) are specifically designed to support different communication speeds, the lowest being 10 Mbps (10 Megabits per second) and the highest being 100 Gbps (100 gigabits per second). The most common speeds are 100 Mbps and 1 Gbps.
TCP/IP	The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is a fancy name for a collection of protocols (remember, protocol = set of rules) that are used to define how network communication should take place between hosts. While it isn't the only collection of protocols used to define network communication, it is the most often utilized one. As an example, TCP/IP includes the definition of how IP addresses and network masks work.

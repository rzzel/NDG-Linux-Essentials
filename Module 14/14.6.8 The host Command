In its simplest form, the host command works with DNS to associate a hostname with an IP address. As used in a previous example, example.com is associated with the IP address of 192.168.1.2:

root@localhost:~# host example.com                                            
example.com has address 192.168.1.2                                           
The host command can also be used in reverse if an IP address is known, but the domain name is not.

root@localhost:~# host 192.168.1.2                                            
2.1.168.192.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer example.com.                     
2.1.168.192.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer cserver.example.com.             
Other options exist to query the various aspects of a DNS such as a CNAME canonical name -alias:

root@localhost:~# host -t CNAME example.com                                   
example.com has no CNAME record                                               
Since many DNS servers store a copy of example.com, SOA Start of Authority records indicate the primary server for the domain:

root@localhost:~# host -t SOA example.com                                     
example.com has SOA record example.com. cserver.example.com. 2 604800 86400 2419200 604800
A comprehensive list of DNS information regarding example.com can be found using the -a all option:

root@localhost:~# host -a example.com                                         
Trying "example.com"

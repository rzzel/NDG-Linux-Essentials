The ss command is a versatile tool designed to display socket statistics, making it easier to monitor network connections and their state. It is often considered a replacement for the older netstat command, but it provides more information and features. Here are some key points about the ss command:

The primary use of the ss command is to view information about established connections between your local machine and remote hosts, as well as statistics about these connections.

By default, running the ss command without options will display a list of active socket connections, including details like the socket type, state, data in the receive and send queues, and the local and remote addresses and ports.

You can customize the output by specifying various options, such as -t for TCP sockets, -u for UDP sockets, or -l to display listening sockets.

The ss -s option provides a summary of socket statistics, showing the total count and statistics for different socket types, including TCP and UDP.

When dealing with extensive output from the ss command, consider piping it through a pager like less to make it more manageable. This allows you to scroll through the results and perform searches.

The ss command is a powerful tool for network monitoring and diagnostics, offering detailed information about socket connections and their characteristics. It's a valuable utility for network administrators and anyone interested in understanding their network's current state.

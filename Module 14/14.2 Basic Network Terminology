Before setting up a network or accessing an existing network, it is beneficial to know some key terms that are related to networking. This section explores the terms with which you should be familiar. Some of the terms are basic, and you may already be familiar with them. However, others are more advanced.

Host	A host is a computer. Many people automatically think of a desktop computer or laptop when they hear the term computer. In reality, many other devices, such as cell phones, digital music players and many modern televisions, are also computers. In networking terms, a host is any device that communicates via a network with another device.
Network	A network is a collection of two or more hosts (computers) that are able to communicate with each other. This communication can be via a wired connection or wireless.
Internet	The Internet is an example of a network. It consists of a publicly accessible network that connects millions of hosts throughout the world. Many people use the Internet to surf web pages and exchange emails, but the Internet has many additional capabilities besides these activities.
Wi-Fi	The term Wi-Fi refers to wireless networks.
Server	A host that provides a service to another host or client is called a server. For example, a web server stores, processes and delivers web pages. An email server receives incoming mail and delivers outgoing mail.
Service	A feature provided by a host is a service. An example of a service would be when a host provides web pages to another host.
Client	A client is a host that is accessing a server. When you are working on a computer surfing the Internet, you are considered to be on a client host.
Router	Also called a gateway, a router is a machine that connects hosts from one network to another network. For example, if you work in an office environment, the computers within the company can all communicate via the local network created by the administrators. To access the Internet, the computers would have to communicate with a router that would be used to forward network communications to the Internet. Typically when you communicate on a large network (like the Internet), several routers are used before your communication reaches its final destination.

Having access to the network is a key feature of most Linux systems. Users want to surf the net, send and receive email and transfer files with other users.

Typically the programs that perform these functions, such as web browsers and email clients, are reasonably easy to use. However, they all rely on an important feature: the ability of your computer to communicate with another computer.

Linux provides you with several tools to both configure your network as well as monitor how it is performing.‌⁠​​⁠​

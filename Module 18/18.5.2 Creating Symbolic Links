A symbolic link, also called a soft link, is simply a file that points to another file. There are several symbolic links already on the system, including several in the /etc directory:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls -l /etc/grub.conf
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 22 Feb 15  2011 /etc/grub.conf -> ../boot/grub/grub.conf
In the previous example, the file /etc/grub.conf "points to" the ../boot/grub/grub.conf file. So, if you were to attempt to view the contents of the /etc/grub.conf file, it would follow the pointer and show you the contents of the ../boot/grub/grub.conf file.

To create a symbolic link, use the -s option with the ln command:

ln -s target link_name
sysadmin@localhost:~$  ln -s /etc/passwd mypasswd
sysadmin@localhost:~$  ls -l mypasswd
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 sysadmin sysadmin 11 Oct 31 13:17 mypasswd -> /etc/passwd

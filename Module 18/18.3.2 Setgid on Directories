Setgid Permission on Directories:
Functionality:

When setgid is set on a directory, files created within that directory are automatically owned by the group that owns the directory.
Subdirectories created within a setgid directory inherit the setgid permission.
Identifying Setgid Permission:

The setgid permission on a directory is represented by an 's' in the group execute position when using the ls -ld command.

sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls -ld /tmp/data
drwxrwsrwx. 2 root demo 4096 Oct 30 23:20 /tmp/data
An uppercase 'S' in the group execute position indicates setgid without group execute permission.

Use Case Scenario:
Example:
Users bob, sue, and tim need to collaborate on a project.
Administrator creates a group team, adds users to it, and creates a directory /home/team.
Without setgid, files created by bob would be owned by his primary group (payroll).
With setgid, files created by bob are owned by the shared group (team), facilitating collaboration.
Practical Implementation:
Administrator's Steps:

Create a new group (team).
Add users (bob, sue, tim) to the team group.
Create a directory (/home/team).
Set the group owner of /home/team to be the team group.
Assign permissions to /home/team: rwxrwx---.
Result:

Users in the team group (bob, sue, tim) can access /home/team and add files.
The setgid permission ensures that files created are owned by the team group.
Advantages of Setgid Permission:
Streamlined Collaboration:

Facilitates collaborative work by ensuring that all files within the directory are owned by a common group.
Simplifies access control and permissions management in shared directories.
Avoids Tedious Adjustments:

Eliminates the need for users to manually change group ownership or permissions after creating files.
The setgid permission on directories is a valuable tool for enhancing collaboration and managing access control efficiently. In scenarios where multiple users need to work on shared projects, the setgid permission ensures that the collaborative environment is seamless and secure.

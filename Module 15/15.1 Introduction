User accounts are designed to provide security on a Linux operating system. Each person on the system must log in using a user account which either allows the person to access specific files and directories or disallows such access, accomplished using file permissions, which are file and directory permissions given by the system to users, groups and everyone else who logs in. These permissions can be edited by the root user.

User accounts also belong to groups, which can also be used to provide access to files/directories. Each user belongs to at least one group (often many) to allow users to more easily share data that is stored in files with other users.

User and group account data is stored in database files. Knowing the content of these files allows you to better understand which users have access to files and directories on the system. These database files also contain vital security information that may affect the ability of a user to log in and access the system.

Several commands provide the ability to see user and group account information, as well as to switch from one user account to another (provided you have the appropriate authority to do so). These commands are valuable for investigating usage of the system, troubleshooting system problems and for monitoring unauthorized access to the system.

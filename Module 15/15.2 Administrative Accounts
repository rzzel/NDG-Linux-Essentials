There are many different ways to execute a command that requires administrative or root privileges. Logging in to the system as the root user allows you to execute commands as the administrator. This access is potentially dangerous because you may forget that you are logged in as root and might run a command that could cause problems on the system. As a result, it is not recommended to log in as the root user directly.

Because using the root account is potentially dangerous, you should only execute commands as root if administrative privileges are needed. If the root account is disabled, as it is on the Ubuntu distribution, then administrative commands can be executed using the sudo command. If the root account is enabled, then a regular user can execute the su command to switch accounts to the root account.

When you log in to the system directly as root to execute commands, then everything about your session runs as the root user. If using the graphical environment, this is especially dangerous as the graphical login process is comprised of many different executables (programs that run during login). Each program that runs as the root user represents a greater threat than a process run as a standard user, as those programs would be allowed to do nearly anything, whereas standard user programs are very restricted in what they can do.

The other potential danger with logging into the system as root is that a person that does this may forget to log out to do their non-administrative work, allowing programs such as browsers and email clients to be run as the root user without restrictions on what they could do. The fact that several distributions of Linux, notably Ubuntu, do not allow users to log in as the root user should be enough indication that this is not the preferred way to perform administrative tasks.

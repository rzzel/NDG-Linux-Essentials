The last command reads the entire login history from the /var/log/wtmp file and displays all logins and reboot records by default. An interesting detail of the reboot records is that it displays the version of the Linux kernel that was booted instead of the login location. The /var/log/wtmp file keeps a log of all users who have logged in and out the system.

sysadmin@localhost:~$ last
sysadmin console Tue Sep 18 02:31   still logged in
sysadmin console                    Tue Sep 18 02:31 - 02:31  (00:00)
wtmp begins Tue Sep 18 02:31:57 2018        
The last command is slightly different from the who and w commands. By default, it also shows the username, terminal, and login location, not just of the current login sessions, but previous sessions as well. Unlike the who and w commands, it displays the date and time the user logged into the system. If the user has logged off the system, then it will display the total time the user spent logged in, otherwise it will display still logged in.

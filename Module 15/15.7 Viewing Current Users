The who command provides a quick overview of the users currently logged into the system. Let's break down the example you provided:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ who
root     	tty2        2013-10-11 10:00
sysadmin	tty1        2013-10-11 09:58 (:0)
sysadmin 	pts/0       2013-10-11 09:59 (:0.0)
sysadmin 	pts/1       2013-10-11 10:00 (example.com)

Username:

root: The superuser/root is logged in on tty2.
sysadmin: Regular user sysadmin is logged in on tty1, pts/0, and pts/1.
Terminal:

tty2: Indicates a local command line terminal.
tty1, pts/0, pts/1: Indicates local and pseudo-terminals for user sessions.
Date and Time:

Displays when each user logged in.
Host (Location):

example.com: Indicates a remote login from this host.
:0: Indicates a local graphical login.
Considerations:

The who command has options like -b (last system boot time) and -r (current runlevel) for additional system status information.

The w command provides a more detailed list of users and system status, including load averages, idle times, and current processes.

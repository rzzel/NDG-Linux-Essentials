Access to a system isn't solely determined by user accounts; group memberships play a crucial role. Each user can belong to one or more groups, influencing their level of access. Let's dive into the /etc/group file to understand its structure:

Group Name: This field contains the name of the group. While names are more user-friendly, systems often use group IDs (GIDs) for identification.

Password Placeholder: Similar to /etc/shadow, this field may contain a password for the group, but it's rarely used. An 'x' here signifies that the password is stored elsewhere (e.g., /etc/gshadow).

GID: The Group ID uniquely identifies the group. Each group is associated with a specific GID.

User List: This field indicates who is a member of the group. While primary group membership is defined in /etc/passwd, additional group memberships are listed here. Users listed in this field are secondary members of the group.

It's common for a username to also serve as a group name, and users often belong to groups with the same name.

To view group information, you can use commands like grep or getent. For instance, the following commands display information about the 'mail' group:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ grep mail /etc/group
mail:x:12:mail,postfix
sysadmin@localhost:~$ getent group mail
mail:x:12:mail,postfix

These commands provide details about the 'mail' group, including its GID and the users (both primary and secondary) associated with it.

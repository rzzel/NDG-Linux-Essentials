Users log into the system using regular user accounts. Typically, these accounts have UID values of greater than 500 (on some systems 1,000). The root user has special access to the system. This access is provided to the account with a UID of 0.

There are additional accounts that are not designed for users to log into. These accounts, typically from UID 1 to UID 499, are called system accounts, and they are designed to provide accounts for services that are running on the system.

System accounts have some fields in the /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files that are different than other accounts. For example, system accounts rarely have home directories as they typically are not used to create or store files. In the /etc/passwd file, system accounts have a non-login program in the shell field:

sshd:x:103:65534::/var/run/sshd:/usr/sbin/nologin
In the /etc/shadow file, system accounts typically have an asterisk * character in place of the password field:

sshd:*:16874:0:99999:7:::
Most system accounts are necessary for the system to function correctly. You should not delete a system account unless you are certain that removing the account won't cause problems. Take time to learn what each system account does; system administrators are tasked with ensuring the security of the system, and that includes properly securing the system accounts.

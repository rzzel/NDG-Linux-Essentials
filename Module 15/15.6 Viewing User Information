The id command is a handy tool to retrieve user and group information. Let's break down its usage:

Current User Information:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ id
uid=1001(sysadmin) gid=1001(sysadmin) groups=1001(sysadmin),4(adm),27(sudo)
uid=1001(sysadmin): User ID and username for the current user.
gid=1001(sysadmin): Primary group ID and name for the current user.
groups=1001(sysadmin),4(adm),27(sudo): Additional groups the user belongs to.

Information for a Specific User:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ id root
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

Displays information for the specified user, in this case, 'root.'
Print Primary Group ID:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ id -g
1001

Prints only the user's primary group ID.
Verify Secondary Group Memberships:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ id -G
1001 4 27
Prints all groups the user belongs to, both primary and secondary.

Check Group Memberships in /etc/group:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ cat /etc/group | grep sysadmin
adm:x:4:syslog,sysadmin
sudo:x:27:sysadmin
sysadmin:x:1001:

Verifies the user's group memberships by checking the /etc/group file.
The id command is versatile and helps users understand their own or another user's identity on the system, along with group affiliations.

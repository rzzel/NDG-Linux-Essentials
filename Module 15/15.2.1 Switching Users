The su command allows you to run a shell as a different user. While switching to the root user is what the su command is used for most frequently, it can also switch to other users as well.

su [options] [username]
When switching users utilizing the login shell option is recommended, as the login shell fully configures the new shell with the settings of the new user, ensuring any commands executed run correctly. If this option is omitted, the new shell changes the UID but doesn't fully log in the user. The login shell option can be specified one of three ways:

su -
su -l
su --login
By default, if a username is not specified, the su command opens a new shell as the root user. The following two commands are equivalent ways to start a shell as the root user:

su - root
su -
After pressing Enter to execute either one of these commands, the user must provide the password of the root user to start the new shell. If you don't know the password of the account that you are shifting to, then the su command will fail.

Notice in the example below, and in our virtual machines, the command prompt changes to reflect the current user.
sysadmin@localhost:~$ su -
Password: netlab123
root@localhost:~# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
After using the shell started by the su command to perform the necessary administrative tasks, return to your original shell (and original user account) by using the exit command.

root@localhost:~# exit
logout
sysadmin@localhost:~$ id
uid=1001(sysadmin) gid=1001(sysadmin) groups=1001(sysadmin),4(adm),27(sudo)

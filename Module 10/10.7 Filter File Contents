Grep Command

The grep command is a powerful tool for searching text patterns in files or the output of other commands. It can match simple text strings or complex patterns using regular expressions.

Basic Syntax:

grep [OPTIONS] PATTERN [FILE...]

Options:

--color: Highlights matched items in red for easier visualization.
-c: Counts the number of lines that match the pattern.
-n: Displays original line numbers of matching lines.
-v: Inverts the match, showing lines that don't contain the pattern.
-i: Ignores case (capitalization) distinctions when matching.
-w: Matches only whole words (requires non-word characters before and after the pattern).
Examples:

Searching for a pattern in a file:

grep bash /etc/passwd

Counting lines that match a pattern:

grep -c bash /etc/passwd

Displaying line numbers of matching lines:

grep -n bash /etc/passwd

Inverting the match, showing lines that don't contain the pattern:

grep -v nologin /etc/passwd

Ignoring case distinctions when matching:

grep -i the newhome.txt

Matching whole words:

grep -w are newhome.txt

Use Cases:

Searching for specific text patterns in files.
Counting occurrences of a pattern.
Displaying line numbers of matching lines.
Filtering out lines that don't contain a pattern.
Ignoring case when matching patterns.
Matching whole words to avoid partial matches.
Remember:

grep is a versatile tool for pattern matching.
Options like -c, -n, -v, -i, and -w enhance its functionality.
grep is often used to search log files or filter command outputs for specific information.

Redirecting both STDOUT and STDERR to different files can be a valuable technique for separating normal output from error messages when running commands or scripts. This allows for better error tracking and log management, making it easier to diagnose and troubleshoot issues. You've demonstrated how to achieve this by using > for STDOUT and 2> for STDERR. This flexibility is particularly useful in scripting and automation where you want to control the flow of both normal and error outputs.

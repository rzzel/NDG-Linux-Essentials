Redirecting STDIN can be less commonly used than STDOUT and STDERR redirection but is still important in certain situations. As you've shown, it can be useful when you want to provide input data to a command from a file rather than manually typing it. This can be particularly beneficial when dealing with commands that don't accept file name arguments and instead expect input from STDIN.

Additionally, redirecting STDIN can be helpful when you need to automate processes and provide input data from a file rather than requiring manual interaction. For example, when scripting or automating tasks that involve multiple commands or processes, you can use STDIN redirection to provide input from a file as needed.

Understanding the principles of redirecting all three streams (STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR) is essential for effective command-line operation and automation in a Linux environment. It provides versatility and control when working with various commands and processes.

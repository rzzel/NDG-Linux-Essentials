One of the most useful expressions is the period . character. It matches any character except for the new line character. Consider the unfiltered contents of the ~/Documents/red.txt file:

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ cat red.txt
red
reef
rot
reeed
rd
rod
roof
reed
root
reel
read      
The pattern r..f would find any line that contained the letter r followed by exactly two characters and then the letter f:

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ grep 'r..f' red.txt
reef
roof
The line does not have to be an exact match, it simply must contain the pattern, as seen here when r..t is searched for in the /etc/passwd file:

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ grep 'r..t' /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
operator:x:1000:37::/root:
The period character can be used any number of times. To find all words that have at least four characters, the following pattern can be used:

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ grep '....' red.txt
reef
reeed
roof
reed
root
reel
read

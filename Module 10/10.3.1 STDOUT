I/O redirection using the > and >> operators is a handy way to manage command output in files. As you demonstrated:

The > operator redirects STDOUT to a file and overwrites the file's contents if it already exists.
The >> operator appends STDOUT to an existing file without overwriting it.
These techniques are particularly useful when working with commands that produce a lot of output, log files, or scripts where you want to capture or preserve command output.

To summarize:

Redirecting STDOUT to a file (overwriting the file if it exists):

command > output.txt

Appending STDOUT to a file (preserving the existing file content):

command >> output.txt

These tools are valuable for creating and managing log files, automated scripting, and recording command output for future reference.

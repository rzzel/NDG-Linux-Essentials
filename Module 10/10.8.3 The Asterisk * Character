The asterisk * character is used to match zero or more occurrences of a character or pattern preceding it. For example, e* would match zero or more occurrences of the letter e:

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ cat red.txt
red
reef
rot
reeed
rd
rod
roof
reed
root
reel
read
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ grep 're*d' red.txt
red
reeed
rd
reed
It is also possible to match zero or more occurrences of a list of characters by utilizing the square brackets. The pattern [oe]* used in the following example matches zero or more occurrences of the o character or the e character:

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ grep 'r[oe]*d' red.txt
red
reeed
rd
rod
reed
When used with only one other character, * isn't very helpful. Any of the following patterns would match every string or line in the file: '.*' 'e*' 'b*' 'z*' because the asterisk * character can match zero occurrences of a pattern.

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ grep 'z*' red.txt
red
reef
rot
reeed
rd
rod
roof
reed
root
reel
read
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ grep 'e*' red.txt
red
reef
rot
reeed
rd
rod
roof
reed
root
reel
read
To make the asterisk character useful, it is necessary to create a pattern which includes more than just the one character preceding it. For example, the results above can be refined by adding another e to make the pattern ee* effectively matching every line which contains at least one e.

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ grep 'ee*' red.txt
red
reef
reeed
reed
reel
read

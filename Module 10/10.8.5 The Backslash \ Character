In some cases, you may want to match a character that happens to be a special regular expression character. For example, consider the following:

 
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ cat newhome.txt
Thanks for purchasing your new home!!

**Warning** it may be haunted.

There are three bathrooms.

**Beware** of the ghost in the bedroom.

The kitchen is open for entertaining.

**Caution** the spirits don't like guests.

Good luck!!!
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ grep 're*' newhome.txt
Thanks for purchasing your new home!!
**Warning** it may be haunted.
There are three bathrooms.
**Beware** of the ghost in the bedroom.
The kitchen is open for entertaining.
**Caution** the spirits don't like guests.
In the output of the grep command above, the search for re* matched every line which contained an r followed by zero or more of the letter e. To look for an actual asterisk * character, place a backslash \ character before the asterisk * character:

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ grep 're\*' newhome.txt
**Beware** of the ghost in the bedroom.

The less and more commands are used as pagers in Linux to view the contents of files one page at a time. These pager commands are especially useful for viewing large files without having all their contents dumped onto the screen at once. Here's an overview of how to use them:

Using the more Command:

The more command displays one page of text at a time and pauses at the end of each page. To navigate through the content, use the following commands:

Enter: View the next line of text.
Spacebar: View the next page.
b: View the previous page.
q: Quit the more command.
Example of using more:

more large_file.txt

This will display the contents of large_file.txt one page at a time, allowing you to navigate through the file using the commands mentioned above.

Using the less Command:

The less command provides more advanced paging capabilities than more. It allows backward and forward navigation, searching, and more. To use less, follow these commands:

Spacebar: View the next page.
b: View the previous page.
Arrow keys (Up and Down): Scroll up and down.
**/: Search for a specific term (type /` followed by the search term and press Enter).
n: Go to the next occurrence of the search term.
N: Go to the previous occurrence of the search term.
q: Quit the less command.
Example of using less:

less large_file.txt

This will display the contents of large_file.txt and allow you to navigate, search, and quit using the commands mentioned above.

The head and tail commands are useful for displaying the first few or last few lines of a file. These commands are commonly used when you want to quickly view the beginning or end of a file without going through the entire content. Here's how you can use head and tail:

Display the First Lines of a File:
To display the first ten lines of a file (by default), use the head command followed by the file name:

head /path/to/your/file

You can specify the number of lines to display using the -n or just - option:

head -n 5 /path/to/your/file  # Display the first 5 lines
head -5 /path/to/your/file     # Same as above
Display the Last Lines of a File:

To display the last ten lines of a file (by default), use the tail command followed by the file name:

tail /path/to/your/file

You can specify the number of lines to display using the -n option:

tail -n 5 /path/to/your/file  # Display the last 5 lines
Negative Value Option with tail:

Traditionally in UNIX, the number of lines to output is specified with a negative option, e.g., -3, which means to show three lines from the end.

Positive Value Option with tail:
The GNU version of the tail command allows you to specify the number of lines with a plus sign to display the contents starting at the specified line and continuing to the end. For example:

nl /path/to/your/file | tail -n +25  # Display from line 25 to the end
Live File Changes with tail:

You can view live changes in a file by using the -f (follow) option with the tail command. This is particularly useful when monitoring log files or other files that are being actively updated. The command will keep running and display new lines as they are added to the file. For example:

tail -f /var/log/mail.log  # Continuously display new entries in the mail log

These commands are handy for quickly inspecting the beginning or end of a file, monitoring log files, or examining files interactively. The ability to display a specific range of lines is particularly useful for customizing your view of the file's content.

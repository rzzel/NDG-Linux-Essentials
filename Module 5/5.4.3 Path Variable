The PATH Variable in the Bash Shell:

- The PATH variable is one of the most important Bash shell variables.
- It contains a list of directories that define where the shell looks to find commands.
- If a command is not found in any of these directories, the shell returns a "command not found" error.

Displaying the PATH Variable:
- To view the current PATH variable, use the "echo" command followed by $PATH.

Example:
sysadmin@localhost:~$ echo $PATH
- This displays the PATH variable, which is a list of directories separated by colons.

Order of Directory Search:
- The shell checks directories in the order they are listed in the PATH variable.
- If a command with the same name exists in multiple directories, the first one found in the PATH is executed.

Modifying the PATH Variable:
- To modify the PATH variable and make it easier to execute custom commands, you can add directories.
- Example:
  sysadmin@localhost:~$ PATH=/usr/bin/custom:$PATH
  sysadmin@localhost:~$ echo $PATH
- This prepends the /usr/bin/custom directory to the PATH variable.

- You can also append directories to the PATH using colons as separators.

The PATH variable is essential for locating and executing commands in the shell. Modifying it allows you to include custom directories for command execution.

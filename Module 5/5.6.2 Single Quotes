Single Quotes in Linux and Special Characters

- Single quotes are used in Linux to enclose text and prevent the shell from interpreting any special characters, including:
  - Glob characters (wildcards).
  - Variables.
  - Command substitution.
  - Other metacharacters not discussed here.

- Single quotes make the enclosed text completely literal, treating every character within them as is, without any interpretation.

- For example, to display the dollar sign ($) as a dollar sign and not as a variable indicator, use single quotes:

  ```bash
  **echo 'The car costs $100'**


In the second command, the dollar sign is treated as a literal character, not as a variable placeholder.

Single quotes are useful when you want to ensure that the enclosed text is treated exactly as written.

They are particularly handy for preventing variable expansion and preserving the original text.

Command Format with Options:

A command typically follows the format: command [options] [arguments].
Options are used to expand or modify the way a command behaves.
Example with "ls" Command and Options:

The "ls" command, with the -l option, provides a long listing with detailed file information.

sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls -l
total 0
drwxr-xr-x 1 sysadmin sysadmin 0 Jan 29  20:13 Desktop
...
Option Mnemonics:

Options are often chosen to be mnemonic for their purpose. For example, -l is mnemonic for a long listing.
Some options, like -r, reverse the default behavior. For instance, -r reverses the alphabetical order of listing.
Combining Options:

Options can be used separately, as in -l -r, or combined, as in -lr.
Combined options do not have a specific order, and their output is the same.
Human-Readable Format:

Some commands, like "ls," offer human-readable format for file sizes, enabled with options like -h.
Single-Letter vs. Full-Word Options:

Older commands often use single letters for options (e.g., -h).

Newer commands may use complete words or phrases as options.

Single-letter options are preceded by a single dash -, while full-word options are preceded by two dashes --.

Example with full-word option: ls --human-readable /usr/bin/perl


sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls -l --human-readable /usr/bin/perl
-rwxr-xr-x 2 root root 11K Feb  4  2018 /usr/bin/perl

What Is a Command:

A command is a software program that, when executed on the CLI, performs an action on the computer.
Executing a Command:

To execute a command, type the command's name in the terminal and press Enter.
For example, typing "ls" and hitting Enter executes the "ls" command.
Example Output:


sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls
Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Music  Pictures  Public  Templates  Videos
The "ls" command, when executed, lists files and directories in the current working directory.
Understanding Command Format:

The typical format for a command is: command [options] [arguments].
Options modify the command's behavior, while arguments provide additional information (e.g., a filename or a username).
Options and arguments are usually separated by a space, although options can often be combined.

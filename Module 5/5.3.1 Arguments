Command Format:

A command is structured as: command [options] [arguments].
Arguments are used to specify something for the command to act upon.
Example with "ls" Command:

When the "ls" command is given the name of a directory as an argument, it lists the contents of that directory.
Example: ls /etc/ppp lists the files in the "/etc/ppp" directory.
Multiple Arguments:

Commands can accept multiple arguments.
For instance, to list the contents of both the "/etc/ppp" and "/etc/ssh" directories, pass them both as arguments to the "ls" command:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls /etc/ppp /etc/ssh
/etc/ppp:
ip-down.d  ip-up.d

/etc/ssh:
moduli               ssh_host_dsa_key.pub     ssh_host_rsa_key      sshd_configssh_config
ssh_host_ecdsa_key   ssh_host_rsa_key.pub         
ssh_host_dsa_key     ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub   ssh_import_id

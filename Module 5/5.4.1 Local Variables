Local or Shell Variables in the Bash Shell:

- Local or shell variables exist only within the current shell session and are not accessible to other commands or applications.
- They are temporary and are lost when the shell session is closed.
- These variables are often associated with user-based tasks and, by convention, are named in lowercase.

Assigning Values to Local Variables:
- To set the value of a local variable, use the assignment expression: variable=value.
- If the variable already exists, its value is modified. If it doesn't exist, a new local variable is created and assigned the value.

Example:
sysadmin@localhost:~$ variable1='Something'
- This creates a local variable named "variable1" with a value of "Something."

Displaying the Value of Local Variables:
- Use the "echo" command to display the value of a variable.
- Prefix the variable name with a dollar sign ($) as an argument to the "echo" command.

Example:
sysadmin@localhost:~$ echo $variable1
- This displays the value of "variable1," which is "Something."

Local variables are useful for storing temporary data and configuration settings within a shell session.

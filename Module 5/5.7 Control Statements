Control Statements in Linux

- **Control statements** in Linux allow you to execute multiple commands at once or run additional commands based on the success or failure of a previous command. These statements are essential for scripting and can also be used on the command line.

- Control statements provide a way to make decisions, repeat actions, and create more sophisticated command sequences.

- They are particularly valuable in shell scripting to automate tasks and handle complex workflows.

Internal Commands (Built-In Commands)
Definition
Internal commands, also known as built-in commands, are an integral part of a shell itself.
These commands are directly implemented within the shell, and the shell executes them without starting additional programs.
Example: cd (Change Directory)
Description: The cd command allows users to change their current working directory in the shell.
Bash Shell: cd is a built-in command in the Bash shell.
Execution: When a user types cd, the Bash shell interprets and executes it without the need for external programs.
Efficiency: Internal commands like cd are generally more efficient because they are part of the shell itself.
Identifying Internal Commands
The type command can be used to identify whether a command is an internal command or an external program.
For instance, to identify cd as an internal command:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ type cd
cd is a shell builtin

Advantages of Internal Commands
Efficiency: Internal commands are executed faster than external programs because they are integrated into the shell.
Availability: They are always available, irrespective of external programs or utilities.
Common Internal Commands
In addition to cd, many other shell-related operations and control commands are internal. These can include commands for manipulating variables, controlling flow, or performing basic file system operations.
Conclusion
Internal commands are a fundamental feature of shell environments like Bash.
They enhance the efficiency and responsiveness of the shell by executing directly within it.
Users can check whether a command is internal using the type command.

Using Logical "OR" with Double Pipe (||) in Linux

- The double pipe (||) in Linux acts as a logical "or" operator. It allows you to run the second command if the first command fails. If the first command is successful, the second command is skipped.

- In other words, you're telling the shell, "Either run this first command or the second one."

- With the double pipe, the behavior is as follows: if the first command runs successfully, the second command is skipped; if the first command fails, then the second command is executed.

- In the following example, the `echo` command only executes if the `ls` command fails:

```bash
**sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls /etc/ppp || echo failed**
ip-down.d  ip-up.d

**sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls /etc/junk || echo failed**
ls: cannot access /etc/junk: No such file or directory
failed
Using the double pipe (||) is a way to conditionally execute commands based on the success or failure of the preceding command.

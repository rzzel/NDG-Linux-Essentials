Command Substitution with Backquotes (Backticks)

- **Backquotes**, or **backticks**, are used for **command substitution** in Linux. This technique allows you to specify a command within another command, making it a powerful tool for more advanced command usage.

- Here's an example to illustrate how command substitution works. Let's start with the output of the `date` command:

```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ date
Mon Nov 4 03:35:50 UTC 2018
Now, observe the output of the echo command:


sysadmin@localhost:~$ echo Today is date
Today is date
In this command, the word date is treated as regular text, and the shell simply passes it to the echo command.

To execute the date command and have its output sent to the echo command, you can use backquotes:


sysadmin@localhost:~$ echo Today is `date`
Today is Mon Nov 4 03:40:04 UTC 2018
The backquotes around date indicate command substitution. The date command is executed, and its output is used within the echo command.

Command substitution with backquotes is a valuable feature for building complex commands and scripts.

Closed-Source vs. Open Source Software:
Historical Software Licensing:
Most software historically issued under closed-source licenses.
Users granted the right to use machine code but couldn't access or modify the source code.
Reverse engineering often explicitly prohibited.
The Rise of Open Source:
Linux and Open Source Software:

Linux development aligns with the open source philosophy.
Open source emphasizes the right to access and modify software source code.
Success of Linux:

Linux's success attributed to adopting open source principles.
Linus Torvalds freely shares the source code, inviting collaboration.
Source-Centric View:

Open source philosophy is source-centric.
Users have the right to obtain and modify software source code.
Linux Development Model:
Collaborative Development:

Linux built from scratch with a volunteer group.
Early adopters influence the project's direction.
Shared Contributions:

Community members take the source code, make changes, and share improvements.
Accelerates development and prevents repeating mistakes.
Impact on Software Evolution:
Accelerated Development:

Open source model accelerates the pace of software development.
Mistakes learned from other operating systems are not repeated.
Community Collaboration:

Linux's success showcases the power of community collaboration.
Source code accessibility fosters innovation and collective improvement.
Key Principles:
Freedom to Modify:

Open source philosophy emphasizes the freedom to modify and share software.
Transparency and Collaboration:

Transparency through accessible source code promotes collaboration and learning.
Linux's Significance:

Linux's adoption of open source principles revolutionizes software development.
Sets a precedent for collaborative and transparent practices in the tech industry.

Linux, in its primary context, refers to the kernel, the central controller of a computer's operations. However, when people commonly talk about Linux, they are usually referring to the combination of GNU software and the Linux kernel, collectively forming the operating system. GNU provides open-source alternatives to common UNIX commands. UNIX, the precursor to Linux, originated in the 1970s at AT&T Bell Labs, gaining popularity for its portability and modularity.

The Linux story began in 1991 when Linus Torvalds, a Finnish computer scientist frustrated with the licensing of MINIX, decided to create his own OS kernel. Over time, Linux has become the dominant operating system on the Internet, although it is not officially certified as UNIX. The GNU Project, initiated by Richard Stallman in 1983, played a crucial role by providing tools and utilities that complement a UNIX-like system. Linux's success is attributed to the collaborative integration of GNU tools, creating a complete and powerful operating system that is widely used today.

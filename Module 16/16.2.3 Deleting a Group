If you decide to delete a group with the groupdel command, be aware that any files that are owned by that group will become orphaned.

Only supplemental groups can be deleted, so if any group that is the primary group for any user, it cannot be deleted. The administrator can modify which group is a user's primary group, so a group that was being used as a primary group can be made into a supplemental group and then can be deleted.

As long as the group to be deleted is not a user's primary group, deleting the group is accomplished by using the groupdel command along with the name of the group:

root@localhost:~# groupdel clerks

root@localhost:~# useradd -u 1009 -g users -G sales,research -m -c 'Jane Doe' jane
-u 1009: Set the UID of the new user to 1009.
-g users: Set the primary group of the new user to "users."
-G sales,research: Add the user to supplementary groups "sales" and "research."
-m: Create the user's home directory.
-c 'Jane Doe': Set the comment for the user to "Jane Doe."
jane: The username of the new user.

After executing the command, check the relevant configuration files:

root@localhost:~# grep jane /etc/passwd
jane:x:1009:100:Jane Doe:/home/jane:/bin/sh

root@localhost:~# grep jane /etc/shadow
jane:!:17883:0:99999:7:30::

root@localhost:~# grep jane /etc/group
research:x:1005:jane
sales:x:999:jane

root@localhost:~# grep jane /etc/gshadow
research:!::jane
sales:!::jane
Note: The password field in /etc/shadow is set to '!' indicating that the account does not currently have a valid password.

If CREATE_MAIL_SPOOL is set to yes, then the mail spool file /var/spool/mail/jane is created:


root@localhost:~# ls /var/spool/mail 
jane root rpc sysadmin

Finally, because the -m option is used, the /home/jane directory is created with permissions allowing only the jane user access, and the contents of the /etc/skel directory are copied into the new user's home directory:

root@localhost:~# ls /home
jane sysadmin

These steps ensure that the user account "jane" is created with the specified UID, primary group, supplementary groups, home directory, and comment. The permissions and mail spool file are also set accordingly.

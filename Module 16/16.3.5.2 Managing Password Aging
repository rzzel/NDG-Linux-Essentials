The chage command provides many options for managing the password aging information found in the /etc/shadow file.

Here's a summary of the chage options:

Short Option	Long Option	Description
-l	--list	List the account aging information
-d LAST_DAY	--lastday LAST_DAY	Set the date of the last password change to LAST_DAY
-E EXPIRE_DATE	--expiredate EXPIRE_DATE	Set account to expire on EXPIRE_DATE
-h	--help	Show the help for the chage command
-I INACTIVE	--inactive INACTIVE	Set account to permit login for INACTIVE days after password expires
-m MIN_DAYS	--mindays MIN_DAYS	Set the minimum number of days before the password can be changed to MIN_DAYS
-M MAX_DAYS	--maxdays MAX_DAYS	Set the maximum number of days before a password should be changed to MAX_DAYS
-W WARN_DAYS	--warndays WARN_DAYS	Set the number of days before a password expires to start displaying a warning to WARN_DAYS
A good example of the chage command would be to change the maximum number of days that an individual's password is valid to be 60 days:

root@localhost:~# chage -M 60 jane
root@localhost:~# grep jane /etc/shadow | cut -d: -f1,5
jane:60

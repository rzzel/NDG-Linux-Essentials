Changing passwords is a fundamental aspect of maintaining account security on a Linux system. Here's a summary of the information you provided:

User Password Change:

Users can change their own passwords using the passwd command.
Executing passwd without any arguments prompts the user to enter their current password and then set a new password.
Administrator Password Change:

Administrators can use the passwd command with a username as an argument to change the password for a specific user.
For example: passwd jane allows the administrator to set or change the password for the "jane" account.
Root User Password:

The root user, while not required to follow typical password rules, cannot have a blank password.
If the root user attempts to set a password that violates standard rules (e.g., too short or too simple), a warning is issued.
Password Rules for Regular Users:

Regular users must adhere to password rules, including length, complexity, and other policies.
Users usually have three attempts to provide a valid password before the passwd command exits with an error.
Viewing Encrypted Passwords:

As the root user, encrypted passwords and other password-related information can be viewed by accessing the /etc/shadow file.
Regular users do not have permission to view the contents of this file.

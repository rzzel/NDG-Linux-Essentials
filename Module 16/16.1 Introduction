During the installation process, most installers create a normal user and either give this user the permission to execute administrative commands with sudo or require the root user account password be configured as part of the installation process. Most Linux systems are configured to allow for one unprivileged (non-root) user to log in, as well as have the ability to effectively execute commands as the root user, either directly or indirectly.

If the computer is to be used by only one person, then having only one regular user account might be sufficient. However, if a computer needs to be shared by multiple people, then it is desirable to have a separate account for each person who uses it. There are several advantages to individuals having their own separate accounts:

Accounts can be used to grant selective access to files or services. For example, the user of each account has a separate home directory that is generally not accessible to the other users.

The sudo command can be configured to grant the ability to execute select administrative commands. If users are required to use the sudo command to perform administrative commands, then the system logs when users perform these commands.

Each account can have group memberships and rights associated with it allowing for greater management flexibility.

On some distributions, creating a new user account also automatically creates a group account for the user, called a User Private Group (UPG). On these systems, the group and username would be the same, and the only member of this new group would be the new user.

For distributions that do not create a UPG, new users are typically given the users group as their primary group. The administrator can manually create group accounts that are private for the user, but it's more common for the administrator to create groups for multiple users that need to collaborate. User accounts can be modified at any time to add or remove them from group account memberships, but users must belong to at least one group for use as their primary group.

Before you begin creating users, you should plan how to use groups. Users can be created with memberships in groups that already exist, or existing users can be modified to have memberships in existing groups.

If you already have planned which users and groups you want, it is more efficient to create your groups first and create your users with their group memberships. Otherwise, if you create your users first, and then your groups, you'll need to take an extra step to modify your users to make them members of your groups.

Following these guidelines for group names can help to select a group name that is portable (function correctly with other systems or services):

The first character of the name should be either an underscore _ character or a lowercase alphabetic a-z character.
Up to 32 characters are allowed on most Linux distributions, but using more than 16 can be problematic as some distributions may not accept more than 16.
After the first character, the remaining characters can be alphanumeric, a dash - character or an underscore _ character.
The last character should not be a hyphen - character.

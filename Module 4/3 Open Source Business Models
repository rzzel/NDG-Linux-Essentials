Making Money with FOSS:
- FOSS being free doesn't mean you can't make money from it.
- The term "free" in FOSS refers to freedom, not price. You have the freedom to use, modify, and distribute the software.
- GPL licenses, like other FOSS licenses, allow the sale of software.
- Companies that add value to FOSS programs can make money and reinvest in software development.

Ways to Make Money with FOSS:
1. Sell Support or Warranty: Companies offer support and warranties around FOSS products. Canonical (Ubuntu) and Red Hat are examples.
2. Create Commercial Distributions: Companies create Linux distributions and tools for enterprise use. They offer products and services.
3. Grow Open Source Projects into Businesses: Many open-source projects become successful businesses. For example, Wireshark started as a network analysis tool and led to a company selling products and support.
4. Package Hardware with FOSS: Companies like Tivo package hardware with FOSS and may add closed-source software to sell products.
5. Appliances and Embedded Systems: Businesses build appliances and embedded systems using Linux, including home DVRs, security cameras, and wearable fitness devices.
6. Cloud Resources and Services: With the growth of cloud-based services, there is an expanding opportunity for open-source programmers. Companies pay for services related to FOSS software.
7. Corporate Contributions: Both large and small employers have employees working on open-source projects. Tech companies compete to influence projects shaping their industries, and others allocate resources for internal use.

These notes provide an overview of various ways individuals and companies can generate revenue from FOSS while contributing to its growth and development.

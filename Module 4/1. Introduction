Software projects take the form of source code, which must be compiled into machine instructions by a compiler to be understood by the computer.

- **Closed Source License:** Historically, commercial software was sold under a closed source license, limiting users from accessing the source code.

- **Interpreted Languages:** Another method involves interpreted languages like PERL, Python, and BASH scripting, where code is not compiled but interpreted by a binary executable.

- **Rise of Open Source:** The development of Linux aligns with the rise of open source software, emphasizing user rights to access, modify, and redistribute source code.

- **Open Source Philosophy:** Users have the right to obtain and modify software source code, fostering a community of developers and users for shared responsibility.

- **Linux Success:** Linux, written in C, embraced open source philosophy, attracting skilled programmers. Linux servers outperformed proprietary systems, gaining acceptance in large organizations.

- **UNIX History:** UNIX, created in 1969, became standardized, with 4.2BSD introducing TCP/IP in 1984. UNIX systems, before Linux, dominated corporate and scientific applications.

- **Standardization and Compatibility:** Standardization of APIs, supported by organizations like IEEE and POSIX, allows easy porting of programs across different UNIX/Linux systems.

- **Importance of Standards:** Standards enable collaboration, making it possible for diverse systems and programs to work together. Open source thrives on collaboration and standards.

Every innovation in computing builds on the work of others. Open source software is a collaboration, and standards are crucial for industry progress.

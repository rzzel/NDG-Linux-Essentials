Open Source Licenses and Differences:
- OSI (Open Source Initiative) founded in 1998 by Bruce Perens and Eric Raymond as a response to perceived political charge and extremism of FSF.
- OSI believes in freely available source code and no restrictions on software use.
- OSI doesn't have its own licenses but has a set of principles for open source licenses.
- BSD licenses, simpler than GPL, are examples of open source licenses with fewer restrictions.
- BSD licenses allow redistribution of source and binaries with proper attribution.
- Original BSD license had an issue of requiring acknowledgments, leading to multiple acknowledgments.

FSF Licenses and Permissive Free Software Licenses:
- FSF licenses like GPLv2 are open source licenses.
- Many open source licenses, including BSD and MIT, lack copyleft provisions and are called permissive free software licenses.
- Permissive licenses allow the inclusion of the software in closed-source products with proper attribution.

Free/Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS):
- The term FLOSS is used to collectively refer to Free, Open Source, and Libre Software.
- "Free" can mean both "free as in cost" and "free as in speech," leading to ambiguity.
- "Libre" is added to distinguish the latter definition, emphasizing no restrictions on software usage.

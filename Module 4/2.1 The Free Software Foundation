Free Software Foundation (FSF)
Founded: 1985 by Richard Stallman.
Goal: Promotion of free software, emphasizing freedom to share, study, and modify source code.
"Free" Definition: Not about price but the freedom to control technology.
Philosophy - Copyleft:
Requires sharing modifications when distributing the software again.
Copyleft ensures all modified versions remain free.
Stance Against Software Patents:
Advocacy against software patents.
Watchdog for Standards:
Vigilant against standards violating free software principles, e.g., Digital Rights Management (DRM).
Licenses Developed:
GNU General Public License version 2 (GPLv2) and version 3 (GPLv3).
GNU Lesser General Public Licenses version 2 (LGPLv2) and version 3 (LGPLv3).
Purpose of Licenses:
Inclusion in source code ensures ongoing freedom of use for all modifications.
Global Impact: Legal tools for advancing free software worldwide.
Open Source Initiative (OSI)
Founded: 1998 as a response to perceived ambiguity in the term "free software."
Goal: Promotion of open source software, focusing on practical benefits rather than philosophical freedom.
Definition of "Open Source":
Access to source code, distribution rights, modifications allowed, integrity of the author's source code.

Considerations
FSF Philosophy:
Advocates for philosophical freedom and copyleft.
Opposes Tivoization â€“ the use of free software on closed hardware devices.
GPLv2 vs. GPLv3:
Focus on Tivoization led to specific clauses in GPLv3.
Linus Torvalds prefers GPLv2, disagreeing with GPLv3's approach.
Conclusion
Influence on Open Source:
FSF and OSI are influential forces shaping the open source landscape.
Philosophical vs. Practical:
FSF focuses on philosophical freedom with copyleft.
OSI emphasizes practical benefits of open source for wider adoption.
Evolution of Licenses:
Ongoing discussions, evident in changes between GPLv2 and GPLv3.
Impact on the World:
From Stallman's desire to share software in 1983 to changing the world through legal tools.
Divergent Views:
Divergence between FSF's strong philosophical stance and OSI's business-friendly approach.
GPL licenses remain powerful instruments for preserving software freedom.

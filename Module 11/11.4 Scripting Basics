You got your first taste of scripting earlier in this chapter where we introduced a very basic script that ran a single command. The script started with the shebang (or hashbang) line, telling Linux that /bin/bash (which is Bash) is to be used to execute the script.

Other than running commands, there are 3 topics you must become familiar with:

Variables, which hold temporary information in the script
Conditionals, which let you do different things based on tests you write
Loops, which let you do the same thing over and over

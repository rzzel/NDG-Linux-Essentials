Understanding file ownership in Linux is crucial for managing permissions effectively. Here are some key points regarding file ownership:

User Ownership:

Each file is associated with a user owner, identified by the user's UID (User ID).

The UID is a numerical identifier, and the association with a username is done by the operating system.

Changing a user's UID or deleting the user may result in files owned by that user having no real user owner.

The id command provides information about the current user's identity, including UID, GID (primary group), and supplementary groups.

sysadmin@localhost:~$ id
uid=1001(sysadmin) gid=1001(sysadmin) groups=1001(sysadmin),4(adm),27(sudo),1005(research),1006(development)
Group Ownership:

Every file also has a group owner, identified by the group's GID (Group ID).
By default, the primary group of the user who creates the file becomes the group owner.
Users can change the group owner of their files to any group they belong to.
Similar to user ownership, the association with a group is done by GID, not by name.
User Private Groups (UPG):

When a user and their primary group have the same numeric identifier and name, it indicates a User Private Group (UPG).
File Listing with Ownership:

The ls -l command provides a long listing that includes ownership information.

sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls -l /tmp/filetest1
-rw-rw-r--. 1 sysadmin sysadmin 0 Oct 21 10:18 /tmp/filetest1
Hidden Files:

Hidden files (those starting with a dot .) are listed using the ls -a option.

Ownership applies to hidden files as well, and ownership details can be listed using ls -la.

sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls -la

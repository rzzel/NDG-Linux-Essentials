Question: True or False: Based on the following information the user bob can successfully execute the following command: more /data/abc.txt?

drwxr-xr-x. 17 root root 4096 23:38 /
dr-xr-x--x. 10 root root 128  03:38 /data
-rwxr-xr--.  1 bob  bob  100  21:08 /data/abc.txt

Answer: True.

Explanation: As previously mentioned, to access a file, the user must have access to the directory. The access to the directory only requires x permission; even though r permission would be useful to list files in a directory, it isn't required to "get into" the directory and access files within the directory.

When the command more /data/abc.txt is executed, the following permissions are checked: x permission on the / directory, x permission on the data directory and r permission on the abc.txt file. Since the user bob has all of these permissions, the command executes successfully.

Lesson Learned: The x permission is required to "get into" a directory, but the r permission on the directory is not necessary unless you want to list the directory's contents.

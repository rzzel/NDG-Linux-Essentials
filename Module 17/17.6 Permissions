The output of the ls -l command provides detailed information about files and directories, including file type, permissions, ownership, size, modification time, and the name of the file or directory. Let's break down the information in the example you provided:

root@localhost:~# ls -l /etc/passwd
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 4135 May 27 21:08 /etc/passwd

File Type:
The first character indicates the type of file:

-: Regular file
d: Directory
l: Symbolic link
b: Block file (related to a block hardware device)
c: Character file (related to a character hardware device)
p: Pipe file
s: Socket file
In this example, it's a regular file (-).

Permission Groups:
The next nine characters represent the permissions of the file:

-rw-r--r--
User Owner (characters 2-4):

r: Read permission
w: Write permission
-: No execute permission
Group Owner (characters 5-7):

r: Read permission
-: No write permission
-: No execute permission
Other Permissions (characters 8-10):

r: Read permission
-: No write permission
-: No execute permission
So, the user owner has read and write permissions, the group owner has read permission, and others have read permission only.

Permission Types:
Each group (user owner, group owner, and others) has three basic types of permissions: read (r), write (w), and execute (x).

Read (r):

On a file: Allows reading the contents of the file.
On a directory: Allows listing file names in the directory.
Write (w):

On a file: Allows writing to the file.
On a directory: Allows adding or removing files from the directory.
Execute (x):

On a file: Allows executing or running the file as a process.
On a directory: Allows changing into the directory and accessing files within.

In summary, the /etc/passwd file is a regular file owned by the root user with read and write permissions for the user owner, read permission for the group owner, and read permission for others.

Question: True or False: Based on the following information the user bob can successfully execute the following command: more /data/abc.txt?

Note that the /data directory has different user and group owners than the previous example
drwxr-xr-x. 17 root root 4096 23:38 /
dr-xr-x---. 10 bob  bob  128  03:38 /data
----rw-rwx.  1 bob  bob  100  21:08 /data/abc.txt

Answer: False.

Explanation: Recall that if you are the owner of a file, then the only permissions that are checked are the user owner permissions. In this case, that would be --- for bob on the /data/abc.txt file.

In this case, members of the bob group and "others" have more permissions on the file than bob has.

Lesson Learned: Don't provide permissions to the group owner and "others" without applying at least the same level of access to the owner of the file.

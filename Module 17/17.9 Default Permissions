The umask command is a feature that is used to determine default permissions that are set when a file or directory is created. Default permissions are determined when the umask value is subtracted from the maximum allowable default permissions. The maximum default permissions are different for files and directories:

file	rw-rw-rw-
directories	rwxrwxrwx
The permissions that are initially set on a file when it is created cannot exceed rw-rw-rw-. To have the execute permission set on a file, you first need to create the file and then change the permissions.

The umask command can be used to display the current umask value:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ umask
0002
A breakdown of the output:

The first 0 indicates that the umask is given as an octal number.
The second 0 indicates which permissions to subtract from the default user owner's permissions.
The third 0 indicates which permissions to subtract from the default group owner's permissions.
The last number 2 indicates which permissions to subtract from the default other's permissions.
Note that different users may have different umasks. Typically the root user has a more restrictive umask than normal user accounts:

root@localhost:~# umask
0022
To understand how umask works, assume that the umask of a file is set to 027 and consider the following:

File Default	666
Umask	-027
Result	640
The 027 umask means that new files would receive 640 or rw-r----- permissions by default, as demonstrated below:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ umask 027
sysadmin@localhost:~$ touch sample
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls -l sample
-rw-r-----. 1 sysadmin sysadmin 0 Oct 28 20:14 sample
Because the default permissions for directories are different than for files, a umask of 027 would result in different initial permissions on new directories:

Directory Default	777
Umask	-027
Result	750
The 027 umask means that directories files would receive 750 or rwxr-x--- permissions by default, as demonstrated below:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ umask 027
sysadmin@localhost:~$ mkdir test-dir
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls -ld test-dir
drwxr-x---. 1 sysadmin sysadmin 4096 Oct 28 20:25 test-dir
The new umask is only applied to file and directories created during that session. When a new shell is started, the default umask will again be in effect.

Permanently changing a user's umask requires modifying the .bashrc file located in that user's home directory.

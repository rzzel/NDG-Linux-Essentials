The chmod (change mode) command is used to change permissions on files and directories. There are two techniques that can be used with this command: symbolic and numeric. Both techniques use the following basic syntax:

chmod new_permission file_name
Important

To change a file's permissions, you either need to own the file or log in as the root user.

The following examples will use a sample file:

root@localhost:~# touch abc.txt
root@localhost:~# ls -l abc.txt                                                 
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Dec 19 18:58 abc.txt

Question: Based on the following information, what access would the user bob have on the file abc.txt?

drwxr-xr-x. 17 root root 4096 23:38 /
drwxr-xr--. 10 root root 128  03:38 /data
-rwxr-xr--.  1 bob  bob  100  21:08 /data/abc.txt
Answer: None.

Explanation: Initially it would appear that the user bob can view the contents of the abc.txt file as well as copy the file, modify its contents and run it like a program. This erroneous conclusion would be the result of looking solely at the file's permissions (rwx for the user bob in this case).

However, to do anything with the file, the user must first "get into" the /data directory. The permissions for bob for the /data directory are the permissions for "others" (r--), which means bob can't even use the cd command to get into the directory. If the execute permission (--x) were set for the directory, then the user bob would be able to "get into" the directory, meaning the permissions of the file itself would apply.

Lesson Learned: The permissions of all parent directories must be considered before considering the permissions on a specific file.

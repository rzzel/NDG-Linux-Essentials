On most systems, there is a directory where additional documentation (such as documentation files stored by third-party software vendors) is found. 
These documentation files are often called readme files since the files typically have names such as README or readme.txt. 
The location of these files can vary depending on the distribution that you are using. Typical locations include /usr/share/doc and /usr/doc.

Typically, this directory is where system administrators go to learn how to set up more complex software services. 
However, sometimes regular users also find this documentation to be useful.
You can access this additional documentation by navigating to the appropriate directory, 
depending on your system's configuration. If you have more questions or need further assistance, please let me know.

Man pages are individual documents, each unrelated to any other man page. While they may have a "SEE ALSO" section referring to other man pages, they are generally independent sources of documentation.

The info command provides documentation with a different goal: to create a structured and logically organized resource for easier documentation reading.

Info documents combine all documentation into a single "book" representing all available documentation. Within info documents, information is categorized like a table of contents in a book. Hyperlinks are provided for quick navigation to individual topics within a specific command or feature.

Info documents often have a writing style that is more conducive to learning, making them suitable as learning guides, while man pages are typically seen as reference resources.

Info pages are particularly useful when you want to understand a topic comprehensively and learn about related concepts in a structured manner.

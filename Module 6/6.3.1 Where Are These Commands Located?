The `whereis` command is used to search for the location of a command or the associated man pages. It searches specific locations where these files are typically stored.

For example:
sysadmin@localhost:~$ whereis ls
ls: /bin/ls /usr/share/man/man1p/ls.1.gz /usr/share/man/man1/ls.1.gz

Here's what the output means:
- /bin/ls: This is the location of the `ls` command.
- /usr/share/man/man1p/ls.1.gz: This is a compressed man page for the `ls` command, located in section 1p.
- /usr/share/man/man1/ls.1.gz: This is the primary compressed man page for the `ls` command, located in section 1.

Man pages are easily distinguishable from commands as they are typically compressed with gzip, resulting in a filename ending with .gz. Multiple man pages for the same command may exist, usually when different versions or sections of documentation are available.

While `whereis` is a useful tool to find command locations and associated man pages, the `man` command is typically used to access and read the man pages for more detailed information.

"The question mark ? character represents any single character. Each question mark character matches exactly one character, no more and no less.

Suppose you want to display all of the files in the /etc directory that begin with the letter t and have exactly 7 characters after the t character:


sysadmin@localhost:~$ echo /etc/t???????
/etc/terminfo /etc/timezone
Glob characters can be used together to find even more complex patterns. The pattern /etc/*???????????????????? command only matches files in the /etc directory with twenty or more characters in the filename:


sysadmin@localhost:~$ echo /etc/*????????????????????
/etc/bindresvport.blacklist /etc/ca-certificates.conf
The asterisk and question mark could also be used together to look for files with three-letter extensions by using the /etc/*.??? pattern:


sysadmin@localhost:~$ echo /etc/*.???
/etc/issue.net /etc/locale.gen

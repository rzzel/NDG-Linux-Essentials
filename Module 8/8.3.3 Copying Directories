The basic syntax for copying a directory and its contents is:

cp -r source_directory destination_directory

For example:


cp -r /path/to/source_directory /path/to/destination_directory

It's important to exercise caution when using the -r option, as copying a directory with many files and subdirectories can be time-consuming and might result in significant storage usage.

And you're correct about the -R option, which has the same effect as -r in the context of the cp command, but it can be used in a similar way with other commands, like mv (move or rename). It's important to be aware of these variations in option behavior when working in the command line.

"The asterisk * character is used to represent zero or more of any character in a filename. For example, to display all of the files in the /etc directory that begin with the letter t:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ echo /etc/t*
/etc/terminfo /etc/timezone /etc/tmpfiles.d
The pattern t* matches any file in the /etc directory that begins with the character t followed by zero or more of any character. In other words, any files that begin with the letter t.

You can use the asterisk character at any place within the filename pattern. For example, the following matches any filename in the /etc directory that ends with .d:


sysadmin@localhost:~$ echo /etc/*.d
/etc/apparmor.d /etc/binfmt.d /etc/cron.d /etc/depmod.d /etc/init.d /etc/insserv.conf.d /etc/ld.so.conf.d /etc/logrotate.d /etc/modprobe.d /etc/modules-load.d /etc/pam.d /etc/profile.d /etc/rc0.d /etc/rc1.d /etc/rc2.d /etc/rc3.d /etc/rc4.d /etc/rc5.d /etc/rc6.d /etc/rcS.d /etc/rsyslog.d /etc/sudoers.d /etc/sysctl.d /etc/tmpfiles.d /etc/update-motd.d
In the next example, all of the files in the /etc directory that begin with the letter r and end with .conf are displayed:


sysadmin@localhost:~$ echo /etc/r*.conf
/etc/resolv.conf /etc/rsyslog.conf

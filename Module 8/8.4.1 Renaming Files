The mv command is not just used to move a file, but also to rename a file. If the destination for the mv command is a directory, the file is moved to the directory specified. The name of the file only changes if a destination file name is also specified.

sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls                                               
Desktop    Downloads  Pictures  Templates  example.txt                          
Documents  Music      Public    Videos     hosts.copy                 
sysadmin@localhost:~$ mv example.txt Videos/newexample.txt             
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls
Desktop    Downloads  Pictures  Templates  hosts.copy                           
Documents  Music      Public    Videos                               
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls Videos                                       
hosts  newexample.txt       

If a destination directory is not specified, the file is renamed using the destination file name and remains in the source directory. For example, the following commands renames the newexample.txt file to myfile.txt:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ cd Videos                                        
sysadmin@localhost:~/Videos$ ls                                        
hosts  newexample.txt                                                  
sysadmin@localhost:~/Videos$ mv newexample.txt myfile.txt           
sysadmin@localhost:~/Videos$ ls
hosts  myfile.txt

Think of the previous mv example to mean move the newexample.txt file from the current directory to the current directory and give the new file the name myfile.txt.

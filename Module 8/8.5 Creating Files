You can create an empty file in Linux using the touch command. This is useful in situations where you need a placeholder or a file that doesn't contain any data yet. Here's how you can create an empty file with touch:


touch filename

For example, to create an empty file named "sample," you can use:


touch sample

When you list the file's details using the ls -l command, you'll see that the file has been created with a size of 0 bytes.


-rw-rw-r-- 1 sysadmin sysadmin 0 Nov  9 16:48 sample

The touch command doesn't place any data within the newly created file. You can later edit or populate this file as needed.

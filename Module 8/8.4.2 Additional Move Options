Like the cp command, the mv command provides the following options:

‌⁠​​⁠​
Option	Meaning
-i	Interactive: Ask if a file is to be overwritten.
-n	No Clobber: Do not overwrite a destination file's contents.
-v	Verbose: Show the resulting move.

Important

There is no -r option as the mv command moves directories by default.

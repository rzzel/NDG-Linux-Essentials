The mv command is used to move files from one location to another. Its syntax is similar to the cp command:


mv source destination

For example, to move a file named "hosts" from the current directory to a directory called "Videos," you can use:


mv hosts Videos

When a file is moved using mv, it is removed from its original location and placed in the new destination. This can be useful for organizing files or changing their locations.

However, it's important to note that moving files in Linux may require specific permissions. If you don't have the necessary permissions to remove files from a directory, you will receive a "Permission denied" error when attempting to move the file.

Understanding and managing permissions in Linux is essential for successfully performing file operations. You'll learn more about permissions and other file management techniques as you progress in your Linux knowledge.

Matching Single Character: Brackets [] are used to match a single character based on a list of possible characters. For example, /etc/[gu]* matches any file that begins with either a 'g' or 'u' character and contains zero or more additional characters.

Range of Characters: Brackets can also represent a range of characters. For instance, /etc/[a-d]* matches all files that begin with any letter between 'a' and 'd', including 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'.

Using Numbers: You can use brackets to match files containing numbers. For example, /etc/*[0-9]* displays files that contain at least one number.

ASCII Text Table: The range in brackets is based on the ASCII text table, which defines characters in a specific order. If an invalid order is provided, no matches will be made.

It's important to note that the ASCII text table can be viewed using the ascii command in Linux.

### Factors Influencing System Specification:

#### 1. **Role:**
   - Console-based for productivity or web browsing.
   - Server for remote access and services.

#### 2. **Function:**
   - Specific software requirements.
   - Scale considerations (single or many machines).
   - Skill-set of the managing team.

#### 3. **Life Cycle:**
   - Determination of service lifetime and risk tolerance.
   - Consideration of maintenance and release cycles.

#### 4. **Considerations in Enterprise Environment:**
   - Major upgrades vs. hardware replacement.
   - Maximizing return on investment in both human and monetary capital.
   - Virtualization to optimize space, power, and automate tasks.
   - Cloud services for reduced physical hardware upgrades.

#### 5. **Stability:**
   - Software releases categorized as beta or stable.
   - Production servers typically use stable software.
   - Open source software often undergoes early peer review.
   - Proprietary software kept secret until public beta.

#### 6. **Compatibility:**
   - Backward compatibility for compatibility with earlier versions.
   - Open source norms prioritize backward compatibility.
   - Versioning of libraries to maintain compatibility.

#### 7. **Cost:**
   - Consideration of licensing fees for proprietary software.
   - Virtualization and outsourced support to control costs.
   - Cost includes hardware, staff resources, maintenance, and future requirements.

#### 8. **Interface:**
   - Historical evolution from switches to punch cards to text-based terminals.
   - Introduction of GUI pioneered by Xerox PARC and popularized by Apple.
   - Ongoing relevance of both command-line interfaces (CLI) and GUI in modern operating systems.

### Conclusion:
Understanding these factors is crucial in determining the specifications of a computer system. The choice of operating system, hardware, and interface greatly influences the system's role, functionality, life cycle, stability, compatibility, cost, and user interaction.

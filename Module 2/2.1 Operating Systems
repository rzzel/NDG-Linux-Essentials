### Operating System Overview:

- **Definition:**
  - Software that runs on a computing device.
  - Manages both hardware and software components for a functional computing system.

- **Key Functions:**
  - Manages hardware and software resources.
  - Implements multi-tasking for concurrent program execution.
  - Provides standard services for user and program requests.

- **Complexity Variations:**
  - Desktop and server OS are more complex than single-purpose device OS.
  - Operating systems used in diverse devices, from set-top boxes to supercomputers.

- **Software Role:**
  - Acts as an intermediary between users and hardware.
  - Includes system software, applications, and the operating system.

- **Major Operating Systems:**
  - Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS, and Linux are the three main choices for computer users.

### Unique Characteristics of Major Operating Systems:

- **Microsoft Windows:**
  - Based on a proprietary code.
  - Administered mainly through a graphical user interface (GUI).

- **Apple macOS:**
  - Fully-qualified UNIX distribution based on BSD Unix.
  - Contains a mix of proprietary code.
  - Optimized to work with Apple hardware and software.

- **Linux:**
  - Diverse, with hundreds of distributions for various tasks.
  - Based on UNIX principles or designed for specific optimizations.
  - Administrated using both GUI and command-line interfaces.

### User Interaction and Administration:

- **User Interaction:**
  - Users can point and click for everyday tasks across all major operating systems.
  - System administration tasks may involve typed commands in a terminal.

- **System Administration:**
  - Windows is primarily administered through the GUI.
  - UNIX-based systems (macOS and Linux) often involve command-line administration.
  - Administrators familiar with UNIX can often work efficiently on Linux and vice versa.
  - Linux command-line functions may have Microsoft equivalents for efficient system management.

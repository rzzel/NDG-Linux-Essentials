In Linux, everything is considered a file. Files are used to store data such as text, graphics, and programs. Directories are a type of file used to store other files; Windows and Mac OS X users typically refer to them as folders. In any case, directories are used to provide a hierarchical organization structure. However, this structure may be somewhat different depending on the type of system in use.

When working in a Linux operating system, it is important to know how to manipulate files and directories. Some Linux distributions have GUI-based applications that allow you to manage files, but it is advantageous to know how to perform these operations via the command line.

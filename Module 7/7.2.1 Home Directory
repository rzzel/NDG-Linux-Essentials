The term home directory often confuses new Linux users. On most Linux distributions, there is a directory called "home" under the root (/) directory. Under this /home directory, there is a subdirectory for each user on the system, and the directory's name matches the user's name. For example, a user named "sysadmin" would have a home directory called /home/sysadmin.

The home directory is an essential part of the Linux filesystem. When a user opens a shell or logs in, they are typically placed in their home directory. This is where users can perform most of their work.

Additionally, the home directory is one of the few directories where users have full control to create and delete files and directories. Most other directories in a Linux filesystem are protected with file permissions, which restrict access.

The home directory is often represented by the tilde (~) character. For example, if the "sysadmin" user is logged in, the tilde (~) represents the /home/sysadmin directory. It's also possible to refer to another user's home directory using the tilde followed by the user's account name. For instance, ~bob would be equivalent to /home/bob.

File permissions and ownership are used to control access to files and directories within the home directory.

For more details on file permissions and ownership, you can refer to future sections of this course.

The home directory is often represented by the tilde () character. For example, if the "sysadmin" user is logged in, the tilde () represents the /home/sysadmin directory. It's also possible to refer to another user's home directory using the tilde followed by the user's account name. For instance, ~bob would be equivalent to /home/bob.

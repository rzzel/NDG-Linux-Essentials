To navigate the filesystem, use the `cd` (change directory) command.


cd [options] [path]
If you provide a directory name as an argument to the cd command, it will take you to that directory. For example:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ cd Documents
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$

This command moves the user from the home directory to the "Documents" directory.

When used with no arguments, cd will take the user to their home directory. For example:

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ cd
sysadmin@localhost:~$

This command takes you to your home directory, and the tilde (~) character represents your home directory.

If you try to change to a directory that does not exist, the cd command returns an error message:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ cd Junk
-bash: cd: Junk: No such file or directory
Remember that the cd command is used to change your current working directory in the terminal. It's a fundamental command for navigating the Linux filesystem.

File Metadata and "ls -l" Command
Each file has details associated with it called metadata. This can include information such as the size, ownership, or timestamps. To view this information, use the "-l" option with the "ls" command. Here's an example listing of the /var/log directory:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls -l /var/log/
total 900
-rw-r--r-- 1 root   root  15322 Dec 10 21:33 alternatives.log
drwxr-xr-x 1 root   root   4096 Jul 19 06:52 apt
...

In the output above, each line displays metadata about a single file. Here's an explanation of each field in the output of the "ls -l" command:

1. File Type:
   - The first character indicates the type of file.
   - File types include directories (d), regular files (-), symbolic links (l), sockets (s), pipes (p), block files (b), and character files (c).

2. Permissions:
   - The next nine characters indicate the permissions of the file.
   - Permissions specify how users can access the file.

3. Hard Link Count:
   - This number shows how many hard links point to this file.

4. User Owner:
   - Every file is owned by a user account. The owner can set permissions on the file.

5. Group Owner:
   - Indicates which group owns the file. Group members have specific permissions on the file.

6. File Size:
   - Shows the size of the file in bytes.
   - For directories, this value represents the space used to track filenames, not the total directory size.

7. Timestamp:
   - Indicates the time the file's contents were last modified.
   - For directories, it shows the last time a file was added or deleted.

8. File Name:
   - The final field contains the name of the file or directory.
   - For symbolic links, the link name is displayed with an arrow (->) followed by the pathname of the original file.

File permissions, ownership, and hard links will be covered in detail later in the course.

The argument to the cd command is more than just the name of a directory, it is actually a path. A path is a list of directories separated by the / character. If you think of the filesystem as a map, paths are the directory addresses, which include step-by-step navigation directions; they can be used to indicate the location of any file within the filesystem.

For example, /home/sysadmin is a path to the home directory:

/home/sysadmin is a path to the home directory of the sysadmin user. This is like step-by-step navigation directions. To get to the sysadmin directory begin at the root directory (symbolized by the / character). Next move to the directory called home. Finally, move to the directory called sysadmin. You have arrived at your destination.
There are two types of paths: absolute and relative.
